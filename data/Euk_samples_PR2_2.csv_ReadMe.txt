	Further description or details

Note: columns 4-5-6 are the exact same than 7-8-9, but were added to match the 16S rRNA matrix format (in terms of column number). This is pertinent to the Rcode. Do not delete the duplicate!

10 - 52 Lake ID [Number of reads per sample]
	Column names are samples ID as in chem.csv
	LCT, LCL, LSA and LSC are lake names ID
	The three letters are the month first three letters
	The two digits are the last two digits of the year
	F at the end denotes a bottom water sample (as oppose to surface for all others)
	LSC had two sampling dates in August 2017, so there is also the sampling day (24 and 31)
