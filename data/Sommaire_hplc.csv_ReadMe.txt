**** Data **** 
Photosynthetic pigments concentrations from HPLC of samples from surface water (0-50 cm) 

**** Missing data code ****
NA

**** Column description ****
Column number ----- Column name [Unit]
	Further description or details

Note: this file contains a 7 lines heading that add information needed to calculate the concentration of pigments (dilution and Filtration_volume). These lines are taking care of in the R code so do not delete or change anything.

1 ----- Time [minute]
	Retention time of the pigment in the HPLC column

2 ----- 0me [ ]
	Unique identification name for each pigment. When spectrum is not visible, unknown carotenoids are identified as "x.p.rention_time", 	while unknown chlorophylls are identified as "x.f.rention_time". When spectrum are visible, unknown carotenoid are identified as "unk_caro_peak1_peak2_peak3"

3 ----- Specter [ ]
	fluo for Fluoresence spectroscopy (excitation 440 nm, emission 650 nm)
	pda for Photodiode Array 450 nm	

4 ----- Factor [ ]
	conversion factor for the pigment from peak area to concentration in microgram per liter

5 ----- Molar_mass [gram per mole]
	
6 - 113 Sample_ID [ ]
	Area under the peak

	Column names are samples ID as in chem.csv
	LCT, LCL, LSA and LSC are lake names ID
	The three letters are the month first three letters
	The two digits are the last two digits of the year
	F at the end denotes a bottom water sample (as oppose to surface for all others)
	LSC had two sampling dates in August 2017, so there is also the sampling day (24 and 31)
